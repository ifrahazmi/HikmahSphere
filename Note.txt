The fix: Made both ports public:

gh codespace ports visibility 5000:public
gh codespace ports visibility 3000:public


The issue is the backend is listening on IPv6 but the healthcheck is trying IPv4. Let me test with 127.0.0.1:

Found it! The issue is IPv6 vs IPv4:

localhost resolves to [::1] (IPv6) inside the container
Backend only listens on 127.0.0.1 (IPv4)
Connection to [::1] gets refused
Fix: Change the healthcheck to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost:
